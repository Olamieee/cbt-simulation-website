Passage 1:
The Amazon rainforest, often called the "lungs of the Earth," spans over 5.5 million square kilometers, covering parts of nine countries in South America. This rainforest is home to an astonishing diversity of plant and animal life, many of which are unique to the region and play crucial roles in global biodiversity. Producing approximately 20% of the world’s oxygen, the Amazon is vital not only for the environment but also for local indigenous communities, who depend on it for food, shelter, and medicine.

However, the Amazon faces severe threats due to human activities. Deforestation for agriculture, logging, and mining activities has led to a drastic reduction in forest area. This not only diminishes the oxygen produced but also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing, with international organizations, local governments, and indigenous groups working together to implement stricter regulations, promote sustainable practices, and support reforestation projects. Protecting the Amazon is essential not only for South America but for the health and stability of ecosystems worldwide.

Passage 7:
Photosynthesis is a fundamental process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, allowing them to produce food from sunlight. This process takes place in the chloroplasts, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. Plants use carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to create glucose, a type of sugar that provides them with energy. Oxygen is produced as a byproduct and released into the atmosphere, which is essential for most life on Earth.

Photosynthesis has significant implications for the environment. It helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing greenhouse gases and maintaining the Earth's temperature balance. Additionally, it supports the oxygen supply, which is crucial for animals and humans. Scientists continue to study photosynthesis to understand how it may contribute to solutions for climate change.
