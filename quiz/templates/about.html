        <h1>About WASSCE CBT Simulation</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="about-content">
        <p>Our platform provides a real-world simulation of WASSCE CBT exams, helping students practice under real exam
            conditions. We believe that by experiencing a timed, interactive, and stress-free environment, students can
            better prepare for their final exams.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to equip students with the tools and confidence they need to excel in the WASSCE exams. This
            innovation aims to enhance accessibility and ease of exam preparation, particularly for students across West
            Africa. By leveraging advanced CBT technology, students gain familiarity with the exam format, improve
            test-taking skills, and build confidence as the exam day approaches.</p>

        <p>The platform is designed to help manage CBT phobia, especially in areas such as Oral English and Reading
            Comprehension, and is focused on making exam preparation more engaging and effective.</p>
